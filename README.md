## Project Idea
Build a system that forecasts e-commerce product demand by analyzing social media trends, news events, and weather patterns. The output would recommend optimal inventory levels and shipping logistics.

## Business Value
Companies can reduce overstocking, prevent stockouts, and optimize their supply chain by reacting to real-world events. This demonstrates a deep understanding of operational efficiency and business impact.

## Data Sources:

Sales Data: Use a generic e-commerce dataset or the Amazon Product/Reviews/Keywords API on RapidAPI to simulate product sales.

Social Media: Use the Twitter API to stream tweets mentioning certain product categories or brands.

External Factors: Use the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data and a News API (like NewsAPI.org) for headlines.

## Technical Implementation:

**Data Pipeline (Batch Processing):**

*   **Data Acquisition:** A Python script runs on a schedule (e.g., daily) to fetch data from various APIs (Twitter, Weather, News). It saves the raw data as files (e.g., `tweets_2025-10-25.json`) in the `data/raw/` directory.
*   **Data Processing:** An Apache Spark batch job reads the raw files from `data/raw/`. It cleans the data, applies NLP for sentiment analysis, joins the different datasets, and engineers features. The final, processed dataset is saved to `data/processed/`.


### EDA & Modeling:

- NLP: Apply a sentiment analysis model (like VADER or a pre-trained Transformer like BERT) to the text data to quantify public opinion and identify trending topics.

- Forecasting: Use XGBoost or LightGBM to predict demand. Features would include traditional ones (e.g., past sales, day of the week) plus the engineered features from your external data (e.g., sentiment score, weather forecast, news event flags).

Dashboard: Create a Tableau dashboard for a "Logistics Manager." It could feature a map visualizing predicted demand hotspots, recommended inventory levels by warehouse, and alerts for predicted demand spikes.
