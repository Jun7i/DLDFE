I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won’t be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions. My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn’t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in. The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn’t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn’t deliver it until 10pm! But that’s an issue with UPS, not the seller. When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn’t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn’t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted. The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on. Life got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead. I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it. When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am). When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone! I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for! Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!\",\"review_star_rating\":\"5\",\"review_link\":\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IP3AW6JCCIH6\",\"review_author_id\":\"AGV4EJPKXIBH34HA77QD7KJF4SCQ\",\"review_author\":\"Chely\",\"review_author_url\":\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGV4EJPKXIBH34HA77QD7KJF4SCQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8\",\"review_author_avatar\":\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png\",\"review_images\":[],\"review_video\":null,\"review_date\":\"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2024\",\"is_verified_purchase\":true,\"helpful_vote_statement\":\"140 people found this helpful\",\"reviewed_product_asin\":\"B07ZPKBL9V\",\"reviewed_product_variant\":{\"Size\":\"64GB\",\"Color\":\"Black\",\"Service provider\":\"Unlocked\",\"Product grade\":\"Renewed\"},\"is_vine\":false},{\"review_id\":\"R1U88WSHEZKTLI\",\"review_title\":\"No regrets!\",\"review_comment\":\"I got this as a replacement phone for my son and it’s in just about perfect condition.

Initially, I bought one for my daughter from a different seller, and it was, to put it mildly, a bit of a disaster. We had issues left and right – Face ID not working, the phone overheating – you name it. So, we returned it, feeling a bit skeptical about the whole refurbished scene. But here's where the plot twists: we decided to give it another go, this time purchasing from the Amazon resellers store, specifically from a shop called Hybrid IT. And oh boy, what a difference! The iPhone we received this time around was nothing short of impeccable. It arrived with all the essentials – a charger, a charging cable, and even a SIM card tool, all neatly packed. The phone itself? It could've fooled me for brand new. This experience really hammered home the lesson that when it comes to refurbished goods, the \\\"who\\\" is just as crucial as the \\\"what.\\\" The quality and condition of the product can vary wildly depending on the seller. Hybrid IT sent out an excellent product that exceeded our expectations in every way. For those of you wary about diving into the world of refurbished electronics, let this be a testament. With the right seller, you can get your hands on a device that feels brand new, without the hefty price tag. We're over the moon with our iPhone 11, and I'll be sure to keep you all posted if anything changes. But for now, it seems like we've struck gold. -------------------- I recently found myself in need of a quick replacement after my daughter accidentally broke her phone. The Apple iPhone 11, 64GB in black, seemed like a promising choice, primarily because we needed something that could be set up swiftly and would perform seamlessly as a backup. Out of the box, the iPhone 11 felt like a brand-new device despite being a model released a few years back. The sleek black finish and the familiar design immediately caught my eye, reassuring me that this choice would not disappoint. Setting up the iPhone 11 was mostly straightforward, especially with the unlocked version making it easy to switch from the old device. The transfer of data and settings from the previous iPhone was seamless, thanks to Apple's ecosystem. However, we hit a slight snag with the Face ID setup - it took a bit longer than expected to get it working properly. Despite this hiccup, once configured, Face ID has been working flawlessly. The iPhone 11's performance has been impressive. The touch screen is responsive, making navigation and typing a breeze. Wi-Fi connectivity is fast, ensuring that browsing and app downloads are efficient. Although it's not the latest model, it handles everyday tasks with ease, from streaming video content to gaming, without any noticeable lag. The main issue we encountered was the initial difficulty in setting up Face ID. It required a few attempts to configure, which was a minor inconvenience in an otherwise smooth setup process. After overcoming this challenge, the phone has been working perfectly. Overall, this refurbished Apple iPhone 11 has proven to be a reliable and efficient backup phone. Its ease of setup, fast Wi-Fi, and responsive touch screen make it feel like a new device. The hiccup with Face ID setup was a small obstacle that, once overcome, didn't detract from the overall positive experience. I would recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone in need of a quick replacement or a dependable backup device\",\"review_star_rating\":\"5\",\"review_link\":\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK768BU3IYLYD\",\"review_author_id\":\"AG63VV75B2JXABUVNFAAN4W7Q3DQ\",\"review_author\":\"Ms D\",\"review_author_url\":\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG63VV75B2JXABUVNFAAN4W7Q3DQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8\",\"review_author_avatar\":\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/31610bf7-4102-4e06-88cf-4019c6b68068._CR0%2C0%2C500%2C500_SX460_.jpg\",\"review_images\":[],\"review_video\":null,\"review_date\":\"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2024\",\"is_verified_purchase\":true,\"helpful_vote_statement\":\"147 people found this helpful\",\"reviewed_product_asin\":\"B07ZPKBL9V\",\"reviewed_product_variant\":{\"Size\":\"64GB\",\"Color\":\"Black\",\"Service provider\":\"Unlocked\",\"Product grade\":\"Renewed\"},\"is_vine\":false}],\"top_reviews_global\":[{\"review_id\":\"R16B1QNE65BCYT\",\"review_title\":\"Pleasantly surprised!\",\"review_comment\":\"So far I have no complaints!
